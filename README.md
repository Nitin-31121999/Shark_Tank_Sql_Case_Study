## SQL Concepts Used

The project utilizes a variety of SQL concepts including:

- CRUD operations: Used for data manipulation tasks such as creating a duplicate table, adding a new column, and updating data.

- Joins: Used to combine rows from two or more intermediary tables.

- CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Used to create temporary result sets that are referenced within another SQL statement.

- Subqueries: Used to perform operations in a sequence or impose logic on a particular row of a table.

- Stored Procedures: Used to encapsulate a series of SQL statements into a single procedure.

- Triggers: Used to automatically record changes in the price of apps in a separate table when an update operation occurs in the playstore table.
